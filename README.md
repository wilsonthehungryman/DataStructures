# DataStructures

Based off of a school assignment (in Java).

The data structures created in this repository are currently: Stacks, Queues, LinkedLists, and HashMaps.
All perform the minimum amount of operations to be considered the target data structure.

Primarily used by myself as a tool for learning new languages.
